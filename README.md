## Overview
Full-stack software engineer with 3 years of experience working on various projects ranging from web development to enterprise applications. I have a strong background in object-oriented programming.

Recently, I have become increasingly interested in the fields of machine learning and data engineering. I have been immersing myself in these topics, taking online courses, attending workshops and reading articles, with the goal of gaining more knowledge and experience in this area. I am excited about the potential of intelligent systems and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

## How can we enjoy together?

In addition to coding, I enjoy spending time on hobbies such as:

- Playing board games like Chess and Dominoes to Ride
- Exploring new hiking trails and camping spots
- Watching movies and TV shows, especially sci-fi and biography genres
- Reading books on various topics, from history to psychology
- Playing football ‚öΩÔ∏è matches or riding horse

If you share any of these interests, let's connect and plan a fun activity together!
